Walkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
Kaleidoscope of a loud, hide beats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore [1]
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts and put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York!)
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing [2]
Like any real love, it's ever-changing [3]
Like any true love, it drives you crazy [4]
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything [5]

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

In this song, Taylor sings about New York.

It will be hard to get me to enjoy a song about New York: I feel
it such a hyped place already. Taylor claims she enjoys New York forevermore [1]
and she compares it to a great love [2-5]. May I remind us that Taylor is, at the moment
of this review, 27 years old (thus too young to say 'forevermore') and that she has had many 
lovers (thus comparing New York to a great love may be an insult).

I do like the melody of the song. The melody *does* make me feel attracted to New York,
makes me feel that New York is as great as claimed. 

But well, the lyrics are in my humble opinion nothing special.
