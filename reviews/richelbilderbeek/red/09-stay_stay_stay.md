I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you [1]
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it [2]
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk." [3]

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad [4]
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
That took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries [5], and now I'm always laughin'
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hangin' out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

In this song, Taylor Swift talks about staying together with a boy.

I can understand this from her point of view: she can freely throw
her (I assume mobile) phone towards him [1], she is allowed to
take the initiative in talking it out [2], and he makes a 
(I assume fun/cute) joke, signalling he also wants to
talk it out with her [3]. The boy appears to be
tolerant to her being mad [4] and domesticated [5], 
and this appears to what Taylor prefers.

From his point of view, I think he should leave Taylor as
soon as possible: she is throwing her (I assume mobile) phone
towards him [1], she wants to talk, instead of taking all
the (probably full) blame [2]. Taylor becomes unreasonable
regularily [4] and, instead of being an independent woman,
likes to shop together, so he has to carry her stuff. 
I hope most men prefer something better. 

All that is left of Taylor to enjoy from this song, is that
she can write a song that is so catching, I still enjoy 
listening it! This song caused me to like Taylor as a person
less, but as a musician all the more.
