```
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street [1]
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall [2]
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all [3]

[CHORUS]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known [4]
Missing him was dark grey all alone [5] 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met [6]
But loving him was red [7]
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you [8]
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song [9]
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer [10]
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong [11]

[CHORUS]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[CHORUS]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

In this song, Taylor Swift talks about the full lifecycle of a relationship.

This song is full of comparisons [1-11]. These comparisons are beyond the common simple
lovesong comparisons. For example 'Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted 
was right there in front of you' [8]. Personally, I think these associations are more
complex than love is. This makes these associations feel far-fetched and artificial,
as if Taylor needs to prove she can writes 'deep' lyrics. I think Taylor is
perfectly able to write about love without these elaborate metaphors.

In the chorus, Taylor sings about the colors she associates with parts of the relationship with the boy: losing
him was blue, missing him was dark grey, and loving him was red. I do not see how missing someone could be
associated with blue. Sure, one can feel blue, but I personally miss the association with the color. Also,
missing someone may make the day appear dull and dark grey, but that fails to make me associate missing
someone with grey. Would missing him be white, her relationship would have had the same colors as the Dutch flag!

I think the melody is rather dull. Sure, there changes in tempo and atmosphere, but it 
feels too calculated, too slick, too uninspired.

I think that love comes from the heart and not from
pseudo-intellectual associations or calculated melodies.
Therefore, I think this lovesong completely misses the point.
