```
Please take down the misletoe
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town

My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell [1]

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time [2]
But there were Christmases when you were mine [3]

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine 
```

In this song, Taylor Swift sings about an ex-boyfriend she misses at Christmas.

I have a hard time relating with the lyrics: I do not dawdle in my emotions
that long and instead move on quickly. Additionally, I do not have these
strong associations with Christmas, for me it not being a special 
evening at all: I am not religious and it is just as lonely as any other [2].

On the other hand, Taylor sings about her loneliness and feelings in a very
sweet way. 

I wish I'd understand the sentence 'I'm doing alright, if you were wondering. Lately I can never tell' [1].

I do hate it when Taylor sings 'when you were mine' [3], because I believe people are not property.
