```
Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
Snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine
```

As you've probably already come to expect. This is another break up song. This time its Christmas though and Taylor doesn't want to be part of the festivities.

She's clearly not over this guy yet as she asks to take down the mistletoe because she doesn't want to think about that right now. Her mother is in the kitchen, worried about her. I personally find it hard to believe that Taylor's mom is still getting worried about Taylor and her break ups. 

Basically this girl misses her old boyfriend, wishes he was there, is hoping her ex boyfriend misses her too and is pretty much having a terrible Christmas. The song sounds nice. The lyrics are pretty bland. There is no metaphorical meaning or something like that behind this song.

Regardless, this is nice Christmas background music.
